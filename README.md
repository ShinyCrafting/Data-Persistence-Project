# Data-Persistence-Project
# This project was made for and using assets from Unity Learn course: https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/submission-data-persistence-in-a-new-repo
# The goal was to show version control & data persistence between scenes and sessions.
# I also added pause function in the game scene; and a reset button to clear the saved high score. 
# Als, if you clear the bricks, it will reset the game scene and carry over your points to allow higher score.
# You can play the game here https://play.unity.com/mg/other/hit-the-bricks-data-persistence-between-scenes-and-sessions
